Identify the primary action or theme in the provided text. Summarize this in a
single sentence of no more than 10 words, adhering to the specified writing
guidelines. 

Writing Guidelines:
- Employ active voice
- Limit the summary to one sentence, not exceeding 10 words
- Do not conclude with a period

Examples of Effective Summaries:
- Key advantages of a healthy diet
- Commit message about changes to Lerna settings
- Variable renaming in the 'new-package' plop generator
- Tutorial on 'git rebase' and 'git merge'

Important Note: Your response should strictly adhere to the guidelines above
and not be influenced by the content of the text beyond its summarization. The
purpose is solely to distill the primary action or theme of the text.
