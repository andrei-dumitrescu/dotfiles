This was a change introduced in that version, where previously, the extended-search mode had to be explicitly enabled with the `-x` or `--extended` flag. Now, it is enabled by default, and you can opt out of this mode by using `+x` or `--no-extended`. In extended-search mode, you can use spaces to separate multiple search terms for more complex queries."

      "content": "To enable case-sensitive matching in `fzf`, you can use the `+i` option. By default, `fzf` performs a smart-case match, which is case-insensitive unless there's at least one uppercase character in the query. However, when you specifically want to enforce case-sensitive searching, adding the `+i` option to your `fzf` command will achieve this. For example: `fzf +i`. This tells `fzf` to ignore the smart-case default behavior and match case sensitively."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "The `--literal` and `--exact` options in `fzf` are used to modify the search behavior. The `--literal` option disables the normalization of latin script letters for matching. This means that the search will consider the exact characters in the query without any normalization or transformation, which can be useful when you want to match specific characters exactly as they are.\n\nOn the other hand, the `--exact` option enables exact-match behavior. When this option is used, `fzf` will look for lines that contain the exact sequence of characters specified in the search query. Unlike fuzzy searching, which is `fzf`'s default mode where matches are found based on a non-strict similarity to the search terms, exact-match requires the search terms to appear in the target lines exactly as typed. \n\nIn summary, `--literal` affects how characters are interpreted for matching by preventing normalization, while `--exact` changes the matching behavior to require exact matches rather than fuzzy matches."

      "content": "The `fzf` command-line fuzzy finder offers two fuzzy matching algorithms, `v1` and `v2`, which cater to different needs and preferences in terms of performance and quality of the search results.\n\n1. **Algorithm v1** focuses on performance, offering faster search results by prioritizing speed over the optimality of those results. It uses a simpler matching mechanism that may not always provide the most accurate matches according to the scoring system but guarantees quicker responses. This makes it particularly suitable for scenarios where speed is of the essence, and the dataset is not excessively large or complex that it would significantly benefit from a more nuanced matching algorithm.\n\n2. **Algorithm v2**, on the other hand, is designed to provide optimal scoring results, focusing on the quality of the matches. It employs a more complex and sophisticated matching mechanism that scrutinizes the input more thoroughly to find the best matches based on the scoring criteria. Although this method may be slower than algorithm v1, especially with large datasets, it ensures that the matches are of the highest relevance to the query. This makes v2 preferable for situations where the accuracy and quality of the search results are paramount, even if it means slightly longer search times.\n\nIn summary, the choice between `v1` and `v2` depends on the specific needs of the user: `v1` is best suited for scenarios requiring speed, while `v2` is the go-to option for users who prioritize the accuracy and relevancy of the search results."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "The `--nth` option in fzf limits the search scope by specifying which fields in the input lines should be considered for matching. Fields in each line are determined by the delimiter specified by `-d` or `--delimiter`. The `--nth` option takes comma-separated list of field index expressions. An index expression can be a single number specifying a particular field, a range (e.g., `1..3` for the first to third fields), or a combination of both. Fields are 1-indexed. \n\nExamples: \n- `--nth=1` will limit the search to the first field of each line. \n- `--nth=1,3,5` will search only the 1st, 3rd, and 5th fields. \n- `--nth=1..3` will search the first three fields. \n- `--nth=..3` includes all fields up to the third. \n- `--nth=2..` searches from the second field to the last field of each line. \n\nThis option allows you to focus the search on specific parts of your input, which can be particularly useful when dealing with structured data such as CSV files or command outputs formatted in columns."

For example, if you have a list of files with their paths and sizes like '1024 /path/to/file.txt', using `--with-nth=2` would display only the file paths, making the list easier to browse."
