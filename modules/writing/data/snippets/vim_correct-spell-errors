```

In insert mode, if you have typed a word which Vim thinks is miss-spelled, an
underline is shown below. To correct this error, press <C-x> followed by s. A
completion menu will show a list of suggestions. You can then choose the
correct one.

- `[s`: go to previous spell error
- `]s`: go to next spell error

The built-in spell checker is not perfect and can create false positives
easily. If you think a word is not a spell error, you can use `zg` to add it to
your spell file. To correct an error, press `z=`. A list of candidate words
will be shown. You are prompted to enter a number to select the correct one. Or
you may use `1z=` to choose the first candidate directly.
