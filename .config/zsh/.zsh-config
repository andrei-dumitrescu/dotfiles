## History

# zsh sessions will append their history list to the history file, rather than 
# replace it
setopt APPEND_HISTORY

# This option both imports new commands from the history file, and also causes 
# your typed commands to be appended to the history file
setopt SHARE_HISTORY

# Save each command's beginning timestamp (in seconds since the epoch) and the
# duration (in seconds) to the history file.
setopt EXTENDED_HISTORY

# If a new command line being added to the history list duplicates an older 
# one, the older command is removed from the list (even if it is not the 
# previous event).
setopt HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS

# If the internal history needs to be trimmed to add the current command line,
# setting this option will cause the oldest history event that has a duplicate 
# to be lost before losing a unique event from the list.
setopt HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST

# History in cache directory:
HISTSIZE=10000000
SAVEHIST=10000000
HISTFILE=~/.cache/zsh/history
